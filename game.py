# I plan on making GO using LLM's to demonstrate that I can
# use git effectively. This will be my first commit and 
# will contain only comments outlining my plan.

# The game will need a backend for the game logic, a GUI for the board, 
# a very simple bot to play against and checks to ensure the moves offered are 
# valid.
